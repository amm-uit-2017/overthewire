=> Click "View source code" button.
=> There found a encoded password "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362".
=> That looks like a hex encoded password.
=> After decoding, found a encoded string "==QcCtmMml1ViV3b".
=> It looks like the base64 but in reverse form.
=> I just reverse the string with python.

	# "==QcCtmMml1ViV3b"[::-1]

=> Then decode the text with hackbar.
=> Next got the password for input box, "oubWYf2kBq".
=> Come back to the home page and submit the password.
