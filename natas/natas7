Natas 7

=> The page comes with two buttons "Home,About".
=> In the page source it says "<!-- hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 -->"
=> When click the button, the url comes with the new parameter "?page=home" and "?page=about".
=> This is similar to local file inclusion.
=> Just go to the desired page with the page parameter page=../../../../etc/natas_webpass/natas8".
=> Got the password "DBfUBfqQG69KvJvJ1iAbMoIpwSNQ9bWe"
